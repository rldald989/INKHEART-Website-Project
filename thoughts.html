            Although sometimes a bit too descriptive, INKHEART was quite enjoyable to read.
        Some things I noticed and liked about the book were how there would be an illustration
        to indicate that the chapter was coming to and end, which was nice to have, because it
        allowed my brain to adjust the setting in my head to more what the author had wanted the
        reader to create an image of. I felt like the book could have been quite a bit shorter, but
        it might not have been impactful otherwise. Since INKHEART would have been originally been
        written in German, I think that the word choice isn't as good as it could have been. The 
        transition between setting and characters was quite nice, the author would write a short chapter
        to describe what was going on with one character and then head back to the main plot, but tying the
        previous chapter into the main plot which really drove the story quite well. I generally enjoyed 
        reading INKHEART, it was thoroughly descriptive and entertaining.
