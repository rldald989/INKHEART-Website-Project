        <h3>The book INKHEART starts out with meggie noticing a 
            man standing outside in Meggie's father, Mo's lawn.
            Mo talks with the man, Dustfinger, and Meggie starts to learn about a dangerous
            man who's name is Capricorn. After learning this, Mo takes Meggie to Elinor's house,
            who is Meggie's aunt, along with Dustfiger who "hitchiked". After this, Mo has Elinor
            hide the book. Dustfiger ends up selling them out and Capricorn's men take Mo to
            Capricorn's village. Dustfiger then tricks Meggie into going to "save" her father.
            They end up handing over the Inkheart book(kind of meta), and get held captive with Mo.
            We find out that Mo has the power to read things into reality, like he did with Capricorn,
            Dustfiger, and Basta. Capricorn then forces Mo to read treasures such as gold into reality,
            using Meggie as a hostage.
