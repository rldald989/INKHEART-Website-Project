        <h2>Summary<h2>
        <h3>    The book INKHEART starts out with a girl, Meggie noticing a 
            man standing outside in Meggie's father, Mo's lawn, drenched in the rain.
            Mo talks with the man, Dustfinger, and Meggie starts to learn about a dangerous
            man who's name is Capricorn. After learning this, Mo takes Meggie to Elinor's house,
            who is Meggie's aunt, along with Dustfinger who "hitchhiked". After this, Mo has Elinor
            hide the book. Dustfinger ends up selling them out, and Capricorn's men take Mo to
            Capricorn's village. Dustfinger then tricks Meggie into going to "save" her father.
            <br><br>
                They end up handing over the INKHEART book(kind of meta), and get held captive with Mo.
            We find out that Mo has the power to read things into reality, like he did with Capricorn,
            Dustfinger, and Basta. Capricorn then forces Mo to read treasures such as gold into reality,
            using Meggie as a hostage. Wanting to leave Capricorn's village and feeling remorse for his
            actions against Mo, Meggie, and Elinor, he takes them to escape Capricorn's village. They
            trekked through the wilderness for a while before coming to a city.
            <br><br>
                Since Elinor is quite
            wealthy, she gives Meggie and Mo a hotel room to stay in. After staying in the hotel for
            a while, Elinor manages to manifest the address of the writer of INKHEART, Fenoglio. Mo
            explains their story to him and seems to have Fenoglio making something in the morning
            after the night that Mo and Meggie left his house. We learn that when Elinor gets home, 
            she finds that her home is wrecked. After this, Elinor calls Mo about her burned books,
            saying she will call the police on Capricorn. After this, Mo drives out of the village
            to the airport.
            <br><br>
                Meggie had found a cat and taken it back to the apartment, but Basta
            and Flatnose (two of Capricorn's men) take Meggie to Fenoglio's house and they try to
            find the INKHEART book, but can't. During this, Meggie and Fenoglio try to convice them
            that Fenoglio is the writer of INKHEART. They get taken away to Capricorn's village by
            Basta and Flatnose. Before this, Dustfinger and Farid had been trying to find the book,
            INKHEART within Capricorn's village. Shortly after Capricorn and his men had returned
            to the village, Mo and Elinor had arrived, after seeing the message that Basta had left
            Mo(It was Basta's name because he doesn't know how to right anything else). While locked
            up in Capricorn's house, Fenoglio found some books that had been hidden by Darius(someone
            who could read things out of books).
            <br><br>
                After reading tinker bell, Basta had found out that
            Meggie was able to read things into reality like her father. Dustfinger managed to escape
            the crypt that he was kept captive in, leaving Basta in his place and hiding in Basta's house. 
            Mo and Farid needed to hide so Farid found them a place. We learn that Elinor had tried to 
            call the Police on Capricorn, but it ended in vain. Capricorn is going to have Meggie write 
            out his hound,Shadow, but Fenoglio, the writer of INKHEART managed to re-write a part of the book 
            to where it would be in Meggie's favor. Continuing, Mo and Farid try to find Meggie before
            burning Capricorn's house down to make sure she isn't in the fire.
            <br><br>
                After making sure Meggie wasn't
            there, Mo cast two lit torches into the depths of Capricorn's abode. Following these events,
            we transition to where the execution would be held. Meggie appears and Capricorn gives a speech,
            showing that Mo, Farid, and Dustfinger were "Dead", but Elinor had wanted to let Capricorn and
            the others feed in to that, so she fed the lie, to trick them. Finally, Meggie was reading Shadow
            into existence, but what the crowd did not know is that she was whisking them out of it. Meggie 
            couldn't bear to read the rest, but she didn't have to, because Mo did. And then they all disappeared
             (for some reason Fenoglio had too.)
             <br><br>
                    Unexpectedly, Basta had still been there, along with the Magpie(Capricorn's mother). Basta took
            hostage of Resa/Teresa(who happened to be Meggie's mother) hostage. When Basta realized he could do nothing,
            he shoved Resa/Teresa into Elinor into Mo and ran away. During and after these events, Dustfinger had been
            spectating, thinking, and when no one but Farid was conscious, approached where they had been.
            He talked with Farid for a while and then takes the INKHEART book to see if he can find someone who can
            send him back. Dustfinger and Farid left Mo, Meggie, and the monsters and beasts that had been conjured
            from Fenoglio's writings.
            <br><br>
                After these events, Elinor had decided to take the creatures of fantasy in, of course the ones who had
            wished to come along. Darius also joined them. In the end, Mo, Meggie, Elinor, Teresa, and many others found their
            happy ending.
            <br><br>
                As a conclusion to Meggie's story, she had decided to take up book writing, to be able to read a story that
            would not bring fear when the words were manifested aloud.
