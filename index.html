        <h2>Summary<h2>
        <h3>The book INKHEART starts out with a girl, Meggie noticing a 
            man standing outside in Meggie's father, Mo's lawn, drenched in the rain.
            Mo talks with the man, Dustfinger, and Meggie starts to learn about a dangerous
            man who's name is Capricorn. After learning this, Mo takes Meggie to Elinor's house,
            who is Meggie's aunt, along with Dustfiger who "hitchiked". After this, Mo has Elinor
            hide the book. Dustfiger ends up selling them out, and Capricorn's men take Mo to
            Capricorn's village. Dustfiger then tricks Meggie into going to "save" her father.
            They end up handing over the INKHEART book(kind of meta), and get held captive with Mo.
            We find out that Mo has the power to read things into reality, like he did with Capricorn,
            Dustfiger, and Basta. Capricorn then forces Mo to read treasures such as gold into reality,
            using Meggie as a hostage. Wanting to leave Capricorn's village and feeling remorse for his
            actions against Mo, Meggie, and Elinor, he takes them to escape Capricorn's village. They
            treked through the wilderness for a while before coming to a city. Since Elinor is quite
            wealthy, she gives Meggie and Mo a hotel room to stay in. After staying in the hotel for
            a while, Elinor manages to manifest the address of the writer of INKHEART, Fenoglio. Mo
            explains their story to him and seems to have Fenoglio making something in the morning
            after the night that Mo and Meggie left his house. We learn that when Elinor gets home, 
            she finds that her home is recked. After this, Elinor calls Mo about her burned books,
            saying she will call the police on Capricorn. After this, Mo drives out of the village
            to the airport. Meggie had found a cat and taken it back to the apartment, but Basta
            and Flatnose (two of Capricorn's men) take meggie to Fenoglio's house and they try to
            find the INKHEART book, but can't. During this, Meggie and Fenoglio try to convice them
            that Fenoglio is the writer of INKHEART. They get taken away to Capricorn's village by
            Basta and Flatnose. Before this, Dustfinger and Farid had been trying to find the book,
            INKHEART within Capricorn's village. Shortly after Capricorn and his men had returned
            to the village, Mo and Elinor had arrived, after seeing the message that Basta had left
            Mo(It was Basta's name because he doesn't know how to right anything else). While locked
            up in Capricorn's house, Fenoglio found some books that had been hidden by Darius(someone
            who could read things out of books). After reading tinker bell, Basta had found out that
            Meggie was able to read things into reality like her father. Dustfiger managed to escape
            the crypt that he was kept captive in, leaving Basta in his place. Mo and Farid needed to
            hide so Farid found them a place. We learn that Elinor had tried to call the Police on 
            Capricorn, but it ended in vain. Capricorn is going to have Meggie write out his hound,
            Shadow, but Fenoglio, the writer of INKHEART managed to re-write a part of the book 
            to where it wouldbe in Meggie's favor.
